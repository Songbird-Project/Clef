Clef is a simple and clean dotfile manager inspired by GNU Stow.

## Install

The only way to currently install Clef is by building it from source.
This isn't too difficult though.
The following is all that's required:

```sh
git --depth=1 clone https://github.com/Songbird-Project/Clef.git
cd clef
gleam build
gleam run -m gleescript
```

Once it's built you should move it into a directory that exists in your `PATH`.
Then you can run it:

> Clef is **not** made for Windows systems.
> Compatibility is planned but is not yet implemented
> and there is currently no install method for the
> platform.

MacOS/Linux:

```sh
clef ...
```
